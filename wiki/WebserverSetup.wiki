#summary Setting up SCGI gateway

== Theoretics ==

Since version 0.7.5 rTorrent may be [http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki/RTorrentXMLRPCGuide configured] such a way that it will accept XMLRPC requests from outside. These requests should be "wrapped" in a [http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCGI SCGI Wrapper]. It's OK. But SCGI cannot be transferred through HTTP-proxy. And there is no an authorization system in the rTorrent - it is open for anybody. It can be fixed in different ways. The most common - usage of a standard web-server. I.e. client refers not to rTorrent, but to the web-server via specific URL (usually - /RPC2) with a request formatted in accordance with HTTP-protocol. And then the web-server removes HTTP Wrappers from the requests, wraps requests in SCGI and sends them to rTorrent. Responses of rTorrent are processed invertedly.
On the way the web-server can perform a check if the client has enough privileges to get access to such information from rTorrent.

== Practice ==

 * If you are the owner of the web-server [http://www.lighttpd.net lighttpd], you need to modify it's configuration file (lighttpd.conf) as follows:
   # Uncomment (or add, if it is not exists) the sting "mod_scgi" in the chapter server.modules.
   # Rewrite the chapter scgi.server as shown below:
{{{
scgi.server = (
        "/RPC2" =>
                ( "127.0.0.1" =>
                        (                
                                "host" => "127.0.0.1",
                                "port" => 5000,
                                "check-local" => "disable"
                        )
                )
        )
}}}
 * For the [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] web-server:
   # Install the module mod_scgi. If don't know where to get it for your sustem, download it's [http://python.ca/scgi/ sources] and compile it by yourself.
   # Add the following string to the configuration file (httpd.conf):
{{{
SCGIMount /RPC2 127.0.0.1:5000
}}}
