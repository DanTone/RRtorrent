== Description ==

The plug-in provides some possibilities on automation.
Following functions are realized for now:
 * *Auto Label* automatic creation of labels at addition of new torrent through the web interface.
 * *Auto Move* automatic transferring of torrent data files to other directory on downloading completion.

== Auto Label ==
Label will be created automatically, if:
* Label is created by template, that can be set in Autotools options page.
* Label is created if label input field in add torrent dialogue is empty.

Template variables:
*{DIR}*
 If there is a variable *"directory =/usr/p2p/downloads"* in *rtorrent.rc* <br/> 
 And new torrent is saved as */usr/p2p/downloads/Video/DVD/movie.avi*, <br/>
 This variable will be *"Video/DVD"*.

*{TRACKER}*
 This variable will be set to tracker name.

*{NOW}*
 This variable will be set to the current date using *strftime()* function. <br/> 
 Default format is *"%Y-%m-%d"*. It is possible to set custom format using <br/> 
 syntax: *"{NOW[:<format>]}"*, for example: *"{NOW:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M}"*


== Auto Move ==
The downloaded torrent data files are transferred to the directory, which is set in configuration, with the same directory structure relative to directory specified in variable *"directory"* of *"rtorrent.rc"* file and then started for seeding.

For example:
 If there is a variable *"directory =/usr/p2p/downloads"* in *rtorrent.rc* <br/> 
 And *"/media/p2p"* is set as the directory for ready downloads, <br/>
 The files downloaded to *"/usr/p2p/downloads/Video/Movie/`*`.avi"* will be moved to *"/media/p2p/Video/Movie/`*`.avi"* on downloading completion.

There was an idea to use this plug-in in case when the directory for ready downloads was a mounted resource such as an other disk or SMB share with common access. 


=== Some features ===

 * The plug-in handle correctly a situation with one data directory for several torrents - files will be moved according to torrent file list, instead of simple directory moving.
 * If there are files with the same names, as for completed torrent, in the directory for ready downloads, they will be overwritten.
 * The plug-in is integrated with *rTorrent* at web interface loading. The plug-in will not reintegrate with *rTorrent* after *rTorrent* restart until web interface reloading. To avoid it, you may add a specific line to *rTorrent* configuration file (see [Plugins#Starting_plugins_with_rtorrent How to start plugins with rtorrent] for details)
 * The event name needs to be left the same (*"automove"*), otherwise the second copy of plug-in will be installed at next web interface loading.
 * For comfortable directory choice on the host for completed downloads it is recommended to install the service plug-in [Plugin_GetDir _getdir]. There will be a possibility of navigation on host file system.
