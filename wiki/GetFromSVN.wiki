#summary How to get a version from svn

== How to get a version from svn ==

To do that the program [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] has to be installed on your computer.
Execute the following commands:
{{{
cd www-root
svn checkout http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rtorrent
}}}
www-root here is a root of your web-server. Usually it is something like /www/htdocs.
If you already have a copy from svn and you would like to update it, execute the following sequence of commands:
{{{
cd www-root/rtorrent
svn update
}}}
For plug-ins the sequence is a bit different (assuming that a version of ruTorrent is already present on the disk):
{{{
cd www-root/rtorrent/plugins
svn checkout http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/plugin-name
}}}
and
{{{
cd www-root/rtorrent/plugins/plugin-name
svn update
}}}
respectively. plugin-name here is name of a plug-in. I.e., for example, create, rss and so on.

It is a good idea to perform all these operations as an owner of the web-server. It will prevent a mess in access rights.

It should be noted that rutorrent 3.0 uses a different svn repository command.  to get 3.0 use
svn checkout http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/branches/3.0/rutorrent
to get 3.0 plugins use
svn checkout http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/branches/3.0/plugins
