How to configure rutorrent, and what each option is for.


== Basics ==

Since 3.0, ruTorrent keeps all config info for the webui (excluding plugins) in the conf/ directory

(for example, if you installed rutorrent to /var/www/rutorrent the config files would be in

{{{
/var/www/rutorrent/conf
}}}

The base install comes with 3 config files:

  # config.php
  # plugins.ini
  # access.ini

For a single user system (or a system without authentication)  It's fine to keep these files in the conf/ directory.  For multiple user systems, or systems using web auth, create a subdirectory for each user in conf/users/ with the webauth username
(note:  This name may or may not be the same as the user actually running rtorrent)

for example, if you wanted 3 users named tom dick and harry and you had rutorrent installed to /var/www/rutorrent you might do something like this:

{{{
mkdir /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/tom
mkdir /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/dick
mkdir /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/harry
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/config.php /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/tom/
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/config.php /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/dick/
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/config.php /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/harry/
}}}

If you want to set up different plugin settings for each user, simply create a directory named plugins under the users conf/users directory, and create another directory with the specific plugin name, then copy the original conf.php file for that plugin to the new directory.  For example, if you wish to have different settings for the rss plugin for the user "tom" you'd do something like this:

{{{
mkdir -p /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/tom/plugins/rss
cp /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/rss/conf.php /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/tom/plugins/rss
}}}

then edit the conf.php file with the user specific settings.

== Limiting settings ==

If you want to limit a users access to specific settings, copy the access.ini from the base conf/ directory to the specific user directory, then edit it accordingly.

This is what the base file looks like:

{{{
;; ruTorrent permissions.
;; By default all flags is assumed as "yes".

[settings]
showDownloadsPage = yes
showConnectionPage = yes
showBittorentPage = yes
showAdvancedPage = yes

[tabs]
showPluginsTab = yes

[statusbar]
canChangeULRate = yes
canChangeDLRate = yes

[dialogs]
canChangeTorrentProperties = yes
}}}

These options are pretty self explanatory. 

so, to limit some of these settings for user tom, simply copy the file to tom's direcory and edit the file, changing the "yes" to "no" under the appropriate section.

{{{
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/access.ini /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/tom/
}}}


== Limiting Plugins ==

You can limit plugins in much the same manner.  It's also possible to have plugins which you allow for one user, but disable for another.  This is handled by way of the plugins.ini file.

The Default plugins.ini file looks like this:

{{{
;; Plugin's permissions. 
;; If flag not founded in plugin section, it finded in section "default".
;; If not founded in this section - it assumed as "yes". 
;;
;; For setting individual plugin's permissions you must write something like that:
;;
;; [ratio]
;; enabled = yes
;; canChangeToolbar = yes
;; canChangeMenu = yes
;; canChangeOptions = no
;; canChangeTabs = yes
;; canChangeColumns = yes

[default]
enabled = yes
canChangeToolbar = yes
canChangeMenu = yes
canChangeOptions = yes
canChangeTabs = yes
canChangeColumns = yes
}}}

to disable a plugin, simply create a section with the plugin and changed enabled = yes to enabled = no.  so, to disable the rss plugin for top you'd copy the plugins.ini file to his directory:
{{{
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/plugins.ini /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/tom/
}}}

then edit the file, adding something like this:

{{{
[rss]
enabled = no
}}}
