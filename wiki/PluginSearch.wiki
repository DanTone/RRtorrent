=Search Plugin=
----
This plugin makes it possible to modify the list of default search engines.  Once the plugin is installed, a new section called "Search" will apear in the "Settings" dialog. Each line in the list should contain a name of the search engine and URL for search in it. The name and the URL should be separated by a vertical line character. If the name is left empty, a horizontal line will be shown in the menu. The URL must be formatted in such a way that words added to the end would be processed by the search engine correctly.

The local search option allows you to search the current list of running torrents.  It also adds a new menu category for each search on the left hand of the screen which will stay open until you close the webui or manually remove it.
