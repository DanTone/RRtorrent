#summary The description of a subsystem of plug-ins.
#labels Featured

ruTorrent is designed with a robust plugin system.  The reason for this is to allow users to customize the behavior of the WebUI, and exlude the parts they do not need [HowToCreatePlugin And even add something we missed, without modifying a ruTorrent code]

== Installation ==

To install a plugin, download the tarball from [http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent/downloads/list the download page] and extract it in the plugins directory. (if rutorrent is installed to /var/www/rutorrent this would be
{{{
/var/www/rutorrent/plugins
}}}
If you use the svn version of rutorrent, you can fetch the plguins via svn as well as follows:
{{{
svn co http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/trunk/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME
}}}

Attention! Please install only those plug-ins you really need. The more plug-ins are installed - the longer load of the ruTorrent interface.

== Uninstallation ==

Simply remove the plugin directory, for example, to remove the rpc plugin you might do this:
{{{
rm -r /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/rpc/
}}}
