#summary Create plug-in description

== Introduction ==

The plug-in provides ability to create .torrent files. After plug-in installation there will be a new item "Create torrent..." in the commands menu, which shows the following dialogue:

 # "Select Source" - type here path to contents, which you wish to seed. Before specifying a path you have to decide, whether you will distribute one file or several. If you create torrent from several files, these files should be placed in one folder. There should be nothing in this folder except them.
 # "Trackers" - the list of trackers on which seeding will take place. Different tracker groups have to be separated from each other with an empty line.
 # "Comment" - it is possible to add comments to torrent (these comments will be displayed at the bottom on the tab "Common" of ruTorrent).
 # "Piece size" - at torrent creation its contents are split up for small parts, which are more convenient in transmission and handle. By means of this option you can select the size of parts. The common rule is that: the more the contents size, the larger should be and the size of parts. In most cases there will be enough to leave default value for this parameter (256Ðš)
 # "Start seeding" - loads created torrent into rTorrent automatically, right after process completion. In certain cases it is necessary to disable this function. For example, if the site, on which loading will be fulfilled, requires torrent "re-downloading" for seeding (it occurs if the site requires password or cookies). If this option is not selected, you should load torrent into the rTorrent for seeding manually.
 # "Private torrent" - disables DHT (Distributed Hash Table) and PEX (Peer EXchange), which are alternative ways of peers reception instead of tracker. It is especially useful if tracker is unavailable for any reason. However some private sites do not allow to use these functions as it does not allow to trace seeding coefficients properly. At the same time site members can seed torrents to non-registered users.
 # "Create and save as..." - is the last step of torrent creation. Procedure is absolutely similar to file saving in any other application.

== Known lacks ==

The plug-in cannot see and does not handle files, that are more than 2 gigabytes in size. This trouble is caused by php limitation on operations with the big files. Pay attention - the *total* downloading size *can* exceed 2Gb. Limitation concerns only each individual file of downloading.

Since the plug-in version of 1.1 there is a possibility to bypass this limitation. For this purpose it is necessary to install the program [http://www.createtorrent.com createtorrent], and to customize a plug-in in appropriate way.

== Additional customization ==

Since the plug-in version of 1.1 it is made in the file plugins/create/conf.php. 
 # $useExternal - if the given variable is true, external program createtorrent will be used for .torrent file creation.
 # $pathToCreatetorrent - the variable with the path to the program createtorrent. If it's value is empty line (by default), createtorrent will be searched in PATH for a web server user. The given option makes sense only if $useExternal=true.
