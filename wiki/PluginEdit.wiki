#summary Description of the Edit plug-in

== Introduction ==

The plug-in allows user to edit the list of trackers and commentaries of the current torrent.

As the plug-in is installed a new option "Edit torrent..." will appear in the context menu of the torrent. Activating this option will open "Torrent Properties" dialog.

The list of trackers should be formatted the same way as for [http://www.utorrent.com/ ÂµTorrent] - different groups of trackers must be separated by an empty line.
The content of the "Comment" field will be shown in the "General" tab.

== How does it work ==

rTorrent does not have a mean to edit torrent's properties on-the-fly. This plug-in just removes the torrent, modifies it in accordance with defined settings and adds it back.
So there are some not always obvious points:

 * If downloading of a torrent have not been finished, after modification it will be re-hashed. To avoid this the modification should be performed either after the download finished or immediately after new torrent is added in the "Stopped" state.
 * Some properties of the torrent (file priorities, download priorities, ratio, etc.) will be lost after this modification.

The way to automatic editing of the list of trackers of all torrents is provided via [PluginRetrackers Retrackers] plug-in.
