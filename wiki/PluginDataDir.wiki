#summary DataDir plug-in description

== Introduction ==

The plug-in is intended for replacement of the current torrent data directory on another. Such operation is required, for example, if the torrent data directory has been moved manually.

After plug-in installation there will be a new item *"Save to..."* in the context menu of the downloading area which shows a dialogue *"Torrent data directory"*. In this dialogue you can specify a new path to the torrent data.

== How it works ==


The plug-in doesn't move torrent data files, and simply changes the data directory for another.

It is required to specify the *base* directory of the data (without subdirectory stored in torrent file), by analogy to directory choice at addition of new torrent.

Any additional manipulations with re-hashing are not made. *rTorrent* re-hash torrent data by itself if detects changes of size or modification time of torrent data files. 
From this the following follows:
 # if the data directory has been simply moved, change of the torrent data directory would not lead to re-hashing.
 # if the data directory has been copied, re-hashing would be done (modification time has varied).

For comfortable directory choice on the host for completed downloads it is recommended to install the service plug-in [Plugin_GetDir _getdir]. There will be a possibility of navigation on host file system.
