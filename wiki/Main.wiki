== Introduction ==

ruTorrent has been developed on the [http://www.utorrent.com/documentation/webui WebUI] of [http://utorrent.com µTorrent] basis. So it's appearance is quite similar to the "parent". Actually ruTorrent is named after the "parent" - rTorrent + µTorrent = ruTorrent. 

== Requirements ==

 * rTorrent 0.8.2 or later, compiled with XML-RPC support. If you don't know where to get it for your system, you are suggested to visit [http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no rTorrent official site].
 * Web-server with php 5.0. 
 * Browser as a local client: 
   * IE 7.0, Firefox 2.x, Firefox 3.x - optimal choice.
   * IE 8.0 - limited support in the standard mode. Works good in the "Compatibility mode". 
   * IE 6.0 - Not supported.
   * Konqueror 3.5.9 - OK, except charts on tabs Speed and Traffic. 
   * Opera 9.x - works fine. 
   * Safari 3.x - works, but pictures may not be displayed when https-protocol is used. Probably this is a browser issue. Try to adjust a server not to make keep-alive connections.
   * Google Chrome 0.2.149.30 - the same as Safari. 

 Other browsers have not been tested yet.

== Setup and tuning ==

 # Download the ruTorrent archive and extract it's contents into the root folder of the web-server. [GetFromSVN Or get the latest version of ruTorrent from svn]. It's a good idea to perform this step under the web-server owner's account, so you won't need to set up rights to files/directories afterwards.
 # Add the string `scgi_port = 127.0.0.1:5000` into rTorrent config file (if it is not present there yet). 
 # [WebserverSetup Setup scgi-gateway on the web-server] to forward requests from /RPC2 to the port is listened by rTorrent. Another way - install the [Plugins plug-in] [PluginRPC RPC].
 # Type in the browser: `http://address_of_your_server:port_of_your_server/rtorrent`

== Not implemented ==

 * Access management. ruTorrent (as well as rTorrent) is a single user system. If you need sharing of the rights to work with torrents between several users - use some copies of rTorrent and ruTorrent.

== Some non-obvious points ==

 * Set the "Receive messages from tracker" option on the Settings pane only in case of  rTorrent v.0.8.5 or later. Otherwise it can lead to crash because of incorrect processing of tracker's messages, containing non-UTF-8 characters, by rTorrent. 
 * Settings of the rTorrent, changed by the user through the Settings pane of the ruTorrent, are valid until rTorrent restart. After rTorrent restart all settings will be set according to the rTorrent config file.
 * If numbers greater than 2Gb are shown as negative, the rTorrent should be recompiled with the xmlrpc-c version 1.11 or later.
 * If the port number which rTorrent is listening for requests should be changed, it is necessary to make appropriate changes into configuration of the ruTorrent - set the same port number in the file rtorrent/conf.php for the variable `$scgi_port`. 
 * Authorization may be provided by web-server's means only and does not depend on ruTorrent. If authorization is necessary, make sure /rtorrent and /RPC2 (scgi module, if used) folders are protected. In case the [Plugins plug-in] ruTorrent [PluginRPC RPC] is used, the /RPC2 folder protection is not necessary.

== Browsers' specialties ==

 * To proper work of context menu and information display in the status bar in Opera and Firefox it is necessary to allow javascript in their settings.
 * F1 shows included hot-keys. Works fine in Firefox only as yet. 
 * Some add-ons for browsers may cause errors in ruTorrent work. For example - plug-in Firebug for Firefox causes significant memory leaks.
