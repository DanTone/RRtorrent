#summary Show_peers_like_wtorrent plug-in description

== Introduction ==

The plug-in changes the format of the values in columns 'Seeds' and 'Peers' in the torrents list.
By default these columns are shown as
{{{
get_peers_complete (get_peers_not_connected+get_peers_connected)
get_peers_accounted (get_peers_not_connected+get_peers_connected)
}}}
For trackers which support [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracker_scrape scrape], is makes sense to show more details
{{{
get_peers_complete (t_get_scrape_complete)
get_peers_accounted (t_get_scrape_incomplete)
}}}
I.e. the sum of seeds/peers by scrape of all torrent's trackers is shown in brackets.
As shown below:

Another front-end for rTorrent [http://www.wtorrent-project.org wTorrent] shows this information similarly.
If you mostly use private trackers this plug-in is useless for you. Scrape is disabled on such trackers and you will have less information than without this plug-in - there always will be zero in brackets.
