#summary HTTPRPC plug-in description

= HTTPRPC Plugin =
----
This plugin is designed as a easy to use replacement for the mod_scgi (or similar) webserver module, with emphasis on extremely low bandwidth use. If you install this plugin, you do not need to use mod_scgi or [PluginRPC the RPC Plugin]. _Note: This plugin requires a faster server, and is not recommended for embedded systems, like a router or slow computer._

It simplifies system setup and adds a layer of security. (There is no /RPC2 mount point exposed with this plugins. _*This does not mean you can remove the "$XMLRPCMountPoint" entry from your rutorrent/conf/config.php file*._)

On the otherhand, because this plugin implements the scgi function in php, it does add additional load (in comparison to mod_scgi)

This plugin was sponsored by [http://forums.rutorrent.org/index.php?action=profile;u=213 Alexander] from the [http://forums.rutorrent.org rutorrent forums], and is the direct result of a bounty.

Use of this plugin reduces bandwidth 10 fold.
