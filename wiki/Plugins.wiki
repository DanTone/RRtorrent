Some functions of ruTorrent are realized by plug-ins that allow users to customize the system to exclude unnecessary parts. [HowToCreatePlugin And even to add something lacking, without modifying a ruTorrent code].

For plug-in installation it is necessary to unpack contents of its archive in a directory rtorrent/plugins. Attention - to unpack without breaking a structure of directories in the archive. As a result there should be a separate directory to each plug-in inside rtorrent/plugins. It is desirable to make this operation under a web service user to prevent problems with rights for files/directories. For plug-in deinstallation you have to delete it's directory, accordingly.

Currently there are following plug-ins:
 # [PluginRPC RPC] - a plug-in for linking rtorrent and a web server.
 # [PluginErasedata erasedata] - adds the item "Delete with the data" to the context menu of the downloading area.
 # [PluginDarkPal darkpal] - just another ruTorrent interface colors.

 # [PluginCookies cookies] - allows to set a set of cookies for trackers with appropriate authorization.
 # [PluginSearch search] - allows to customize search engines.
