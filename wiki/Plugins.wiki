ruTorrent is designed with a robust plugin system.  The reason for this is to allow users to customize the behavior of the WebUI, and exlude the parts they do not need [HowToCreatePlugin And even add something we missed, without modifying a ruTorrent code]

== Installation ==

To install a plugin, download the tarball from [http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent/downloads/list the download page] and extract it in the plugins directory. (if rutorrent is installed to /var/www/rutorrent this would be
{{{
/var/www/rutorrent/plugins
}}}
If you use the svn version of rutorrent, you can fetch the plguins via svn as well as follows:
{{{
svn co http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/trunk/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME
}}}

Attention! Please install only those plug-ins you really need. The more plug-ins are installed - the longer load of the ruTorrent interface.

== Uninstallation ==

 # remove the plugin directory, for example, to remove the rpc plugin you might do this:
{{{
rm -r /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/rpc/
}}}
 # restart rtorrent. _*This is important for plugins which work with the rtorrent scheduler, such plugins will send a command to rtorrent telling it to do something every x minutes. If you do not restart rtorrent, this even will keep occuring.*_

== plugin.ini ==

*_Some of the following information is also included in [Config#Limiting_Plugins Config page]_*

Since 3.0, rutorrent includes a configuration file for plugins called plugin.ini.  It is located at rutorrent/conf/plugins.ini.  As of the writing of this wiki, the default format is as follows:

{{{
;; Plugin's permissions. 
;; If flag not founded in plugin section, it finded in section "default".
;; If not founded in this section - it assumed as "yes". 
;;
;; For setting individual plugin's permissions you must write something like that:
;;
;; [ratio]
;; enabled = yes
;; canChangeToolbar = yes
;; canChangeMenu = yes
;; canChangeOptions = no
;; canChangeTabs = yes
;; canChangeColumns = yes

[default]
enabled = yes
canChangeToolbar = yes
canChangeMenu = yes
canChangeOptions = yes
canChangeTabs = yes
canChangeColumns = yes
}}}

These options allow you to change how each plugin behaves and allow you to create a unique configuration for multiple user systems.

For a multiuser system with rutorrent installed at /var/www/rutorrent with users tom dick and harry you would do something like:

{{{
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/plugins.ini /var/www/rutorrent/users/tom
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/plugins.ini /var/www/rutorrent/users/dick
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/plugins.ini /var/www/rutorrent/users/harry
}}} 

and edit each accordingly.  For more information about multi-user setups, see [Config] and [Installation#Single_user_(or_no_Web_Auth)_OR_Multiuser_(Web_Auth) Installation]

=== Explanation of plugin.ini settings ===

 * *enabled* - this setting should be obvious, when set to yes, a plugin is enabled.  When set to no, it is not.
 * *canChangeToolbar* - this setting controls whether or not a plugin can make changes to the main toolbar.
 * *canChangeMenu* - this setting controls whether or not the plugin can effect the rightclick menu.
 * *canChangeOptions* - this setting controls whether or not the plugin can add to the "Settings" menu.
 * *canChangeTabs* - this setting controls whether or not a plugin can add a tab to the tab bar.
 * *canChangeColumns* - this setting controls whether or not a plugin can add a data column to the torrent information window.
  
=== An Example of how to use plugins.ini ===

So why is this useful? Using our 3 user system from the earlier example, lets say
for harry and dick, you want to completely disable the [PluginRSS RSS] plugin, but you wish to allow tom access to it. You would install [PluginRSS RSS] and add the following to both */var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/harry/plugins.ini* and */var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/dick/plugins.ini

{{{
[rss]
enabled = no
}}}

Lets say you want to let tom use the [PluginUnpack unpack] plugin, but you do not want him to be able to enable "automatic unpack" via the settings window. You might add soemthing like this to */var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/tom/plugins.ini*

{{{
[unpack]
enabled = yes               
canChangeToolbar = yes      
canChangeMenu = yes         
canChangeOptions = no      
canChangeTabs = yes         
canChangeColumns = yes
}}}
