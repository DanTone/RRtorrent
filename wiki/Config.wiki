How to configure rtorrent, and what each option is for.


== Basics ==

Since 3.0, ruTorrent keeps all config info for the webui (excluding plugins) in the conf/ directory

(for example, if you installed rutorrent to /var/www/rutorrent the config files would be in

{{{
/var/www/rutorrent/conf
}}}

The base install comes with 3 config files:

  # config.php
  # plugins.ini
  # access.ini

For a single user system (or a system without authentication)  It's fine to keep these files in the conf/ directory.  For multiple user systems, or systems using web auth, create a subdirectory for each user in conf/users/ with the webauth username
(note:  This name may or may not be the same as the user actually running rtorrent)

for example, if you wanted 3 users named tom dick and harry and you had rutorrent installed to /var/www/rutorrent you might do something like this:

{{{
mkdir /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/tom
mkdir /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/dick
mkdir /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/harry
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/config.php /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/tom/
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/config.php /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/dick/
cp /var/www/rutorrent/conf/config.php /var/www/rutorrent/conf/users/harry/
}}}
