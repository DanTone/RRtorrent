   # Fixed incorrect behavior ruTorrent at attempt to add a torrent-file with incorrect content (refers mainly to automatic downloads via plug-in [PluginRSS RSS]).
   # Fixed incorrect method of determination of the web-server's user ID. Before this it was assumed as owner of the script file. Refers to the diagnostics sub-system's work.
   # Fixed incorrect method of determination of the rTorrent user ID. Before this it could not be determined if user had no access to the file rtorrent.lock. Refers to the diagnostics sub-system's work.
   # Fixed opacity during moving of columns in the list of torrents (in some browsers).
