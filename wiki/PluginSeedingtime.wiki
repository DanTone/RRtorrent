#summary SeedingTime plug-in decription

== Introduction ==

The plug-in adds the column 'Finished' to the torrents list. This column contains the time when download of the torrent was completed.
As example:

Of course the column contains values only for torrents completed after the plug-in installed.

== Requirements ==

 * rTorrent version >= 0.8.5
