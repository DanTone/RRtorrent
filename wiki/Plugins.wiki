#summary The description of a subsystem of plug-ins.
#labels Featured

Some functions of ruTorrent are realized by plug-ins that allow users to customize the system to exclude unnecessary parts. [HowToCreatePlugin And even to add something missed, without modifying a ruTorrent code].

For plug-in installation it is necessary to unpack contents of its archive in the directory rtorrent/plugins. Note - to unpack without breaking a structure of directories in the archive. As a result there should be a separate directory for each plug-in inside rtorrent/plugins. It is recommended to perform this operation under a web service user to prevent problems with rights for files/directories. For plug-in deinstallation you have to delete it's directory, accordingly (and, for some plug-ins, restart rTorrent).

Attention! Please install only those plug-ins you really need. The more plug-ins are installed - the longer load of the ruTorrent interface.

Currently there are following plug-ins:
 # [PluginRPC RPC] - a plug-in for linking rtorrent and a web server.
 # [PluginErasedata erasedata] - adds the item "Delete with the data" to the context menu of the torrent.
