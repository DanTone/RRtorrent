#summary DataDir plug-in description

== Introduction ==

The plug-in is intended for replacement of the current torrent data directory on another. Such operation is required, for example, if the torrent data directory has been moved manually.

After plug-in installation there would be a new item *"Save to..."* in the context menu of the downloading area which shows a dialogue *"Torrent data directory"*. In this dialogue you can specify new path to the torrent data.

== How it works ==


The plug-in doesn't move torrent data files, and simply changes the directory of the data for another.

It is required to specify the *base* directory of the data (without a subdirectory stored in torrent file), by analogy to a directory choice at addition of new torrent.

Any additional manipulations with re-hashing are not made. *rTorrent* re-hash torrents data by itself if detects changes of size or modification time of torrent data files. 
From this the following follows:
 # if the directory of the data has been simply moved, change of the torrents data directory should not lead to re-hashing.
 # if the directory of the data has been copied, re-hashing will be made (modification time has varied).

For comfortable a choice of the directory on a host for completed downloads it is recommended to install a service plug-in [Plugin_GetDir _getdir]. There will be a possibility of navigation on a host file system.
